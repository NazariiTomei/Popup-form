    question:
      "What should I know about my listings, tracking companies, marketplace alerts and company browsing?",

      "Tracking notifications are real-time and on a periodic basis.  If you cancel your upgraded account, any notifications or alerts you were receiving will continue only until the end of your subscription cycle.  If you cancel your Elite membership, any access to Elite data you have will be removed at the end of your current subscription cycle.  For companies or marketplaces tracked, you will no longer receive Elite member notifications.  Certain search and browsing restrictions apply if an unusually high number of queries are executed in a short time period, in order to prevent system abuse.",
